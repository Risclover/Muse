# Update(s)
03/01/2022 - This Muse tribute page was my very first time using JavaScript on my own. Although it isn't anything extraordinary, it helped enhance my page a little bit.

This page is actually a redo of another Muse page that ended up looking like this (which you'll find is actually fairly similar to my redo):

And here is the current, redone version of this page:

## Updated Features
Here is a list of some new and/or changed features:
- I added a navigation bar at the top. Clicking on one of the items makes the page jump to that section.
- After you scroll down a little bit, a small button with a hand icon appears in the bottom right-hand corner. This is a subtle "Back to Top" button, and clicking it brings you, well, back to the top of the page.
- The "Discography" section now has a button that says "Show Tracks". Clicking on this opens the list of tracks for that album. You can click on the button again (which now says "Hide Tracks") to close the list.
- Most obviously, I've changed the appearance of the page a bit.
    - Instead of white text on a black background, I now have a gradient background that changes a few different colors as you go down the page.
    - I've changed the layouts of some of the sections.
- This page is now fully responsive (from 325px all the way up). The prior version was not.
- You can now click on an album cover, which will take you to that album's full album on Youtube.
